*Between stimulus and response there is space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.* - Viktor E. Frankl


*The ignorance takes suchness and divides it into self and other. And the line that is drawn becomes the battlezone for craving and aversion. The battle between self and other. And the self always loses.* - Culadasa (Tcmc curriculum, Part 7 Minute 38)

*While we wait for life, lift passes* - Seneca

*Suffering arises from trying to control what is uncontrollable or from neglecting what is within our power* - Epictetus

*The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem.* - Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)

*Any understanding of the world or even of Buddhist practice is a construct of the mind. Paradoxically, for practitioners, Buddhist teachings are constructs of mind that point beyond themselves.* Gil Fronsdal, [source](htps://www.inquiringmind.com/article/3102_14_fronsdal-when-mindfulness-is-too-much/)
